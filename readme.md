# Hey Samuel, what's up?
Samuel, first I need to say that I don't got the point about your project, once it is very simple with a simple screen inside the App.js file.  
As we talked on our class' classes, React Native is a framework that allows you to create mobile apps using JavaScript or TypeScript and uses, essentially, components to build the interface, turning the code more readable and reusable.  

### What I want from you for the next weeks:
- [ ] 1 Define your project theme.
- [ ] 2 Define the functionalities that your app will have.
- [ ] 3 Draw the screens of your app. It could be on paper or using a tool like Figma. I want minimally 3 screens.
- [ ] 4 Start to break your screens into components.
- [ ] 5 Apply a navigation between your screens.

### Where you will find those contents to help you:
- [ ] [React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
- [ ] [React Navigation Docs](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started)
- [ ]  Course Digital Content under the SAVA platform.

### When I want to see it:
- Points 1-4: next two weeks (on 3rd November, 2022).
- Point 5: one week after the previous date (on 10th November, 2022).

When you define and did all the points above, send me a message on the WhatsApp platform and we will schedule a new date with the points do be delivered on the december beginning.
